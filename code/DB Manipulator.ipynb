Later DXCon and of course now DXQB became able to handle system consumables for Automation Systems and therefore the work-abound-relations are not needed anymore and were removed.\\n\\nThe reason why the error (in this case it is not necessarily an error, more a note) is not reproduceable anymore is that the quote was saved in the meantime in DXQB and the relations that don't match the master data anymore and not part of the saved quote data anymore.\\n\\nHope that explains what is happening here.\\n\\nCan the ticktet be closed or are there additional questions?\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\n    Till\", None, 'The root cause is the removal of outdated system consumable relations in the product master data, which affected item availability in quotes.'), ('INC4934316', '[NO_TIMESTAMP]\\nAll global product/systems (Status: Apr 25) with their respective IT Global Product System Category.\\n\\nPlease note: Some products/systems have an assignment to multiple categories (marked blue)\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-04-17T08:26:40]\\nAll global product/systems (Status: Apr 25) with their respective IT Global Product System Category.\\n\\nPlease note: Some products/systems have an assignment to multiple categories (marked blue)\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-04-17T19:42:28]\\nDear @Andreas Ilgenfritz (SHS CE SHV INV) :\\nwe are working on the same, will update the status on monday\\nThanks and regards,\\nPMD team\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-04-21T10:32:07]\\nDear @Andreas Ilgenfritz (SHS CE SHV INV) :\\nwe are working on the same, will update the status on monday\\nThanks and regards,\\nPMD team\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-04-21T10:33:10]\\nDear @Andreas Ilgenfritz (SHS CE SHV INV) :\\nwe are working on the same, will update the status shortly\\nThanks and regards,\\nPMD team\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-04-22T17:44:42]\\nDear @Andreas Ilgenfritz (SHS CE SHV INV) :\\nwe have updated the IT Global Product System Category in MCMn prod as per the list provided\\nNote: there are few failed cases where the system does not exists / attribute value does not exists\\nwe have updated the values manually  for the attached screenshot systems\\n\\nThanks and regards,\\nPMD team\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-04-23T08:18:46]\\nDear @Andreas Ilgenfritz (SHS CE SHV INV) :\\nwe have updated the IT Global Product System Category in MCMn prod as per the list provided\\nNote: there are few failed cases where the system does not exists / attribute value does not exists\\nwe have updated the values manually for the attached screenshot systems\\n\\nThanks and regards,\\nPMD team\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-04-23T08:46:21]\\nHey, many thanks for the update.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-04-23T10:29:09]\\nHey, I would have another request.

This issue seems to have caused one insert operation to fail out of 20859 total inserts and some updates.\\n\\nHere\\'s a summary of the key points from the provided logs:\\n\\n1. **Error Details**:\\n   - The error occurred while handling an item in the import process.\\n   - A `NullPointerException` was thrown when trying to call a method on a null object, specifically related to reports or items within the import queue.\\n   \\n2. **Impact of Error**:\\n   - One insert operation failed out of 20859 total inserts.\\n   - There were also some updates that succeeded and others that remained unchanged.\\n\\n3. **Work Notes**:\\n   - A work note was created for Martin Bali regarding a topic related to Pirobase for the next day\\'s discussion.\\n\\n### Steps to Address the Issue\\n\\n1. **Identify Null Object**:\\n   - Determine which object is null when the `NullPointerException` occurs.\\n   - Check if there are any specific conditions or configurations that could lead to this object being null during import operations.\\n\\n2. **Review Code and Logs**:\\n   - Review the code around where the exception was thrown, specifically in `CommonItemImportQueue.java:551`.\\n   - Look at the logs for more detailed information about the failed insert operation and any preceding events that might provide context.\\n\\n3. **Handle Null Cases**:\\n   - Add null checks to prevent calling methods on null objects.\\n   - Ensure that all necessary data is present before attempting operations that rely on non-null values.\\n\\n4. **Testing**:\\n   - Test the import process with a variety of datasets, including edge cases and scenarios where certain fields might be missing or null.\\n   - Verify that the system handles these situations gracefully without throwing exceptions.\\n\\n5. **Documentation and Communication**:\\n   - Document any changes made to handle null objects and prevent future occurrences of this error.\\n   - Communicate the findings and resolution steps with relevant stakeholders, such as Martin Bali, who has been noted for a discussion on Pirobase.\\n\\n### Example Code Fix\\n\\nHere is an example of how you might add a null check in `CommonItemImportQueue.java`:\\n\\n```java\\npublic void addToQueue(Item item) {\\n    if (item != null && item.getReport() != null) {\\n        // Proceed with adding the item to the queue\\n        this.queue.add(item);\\n        storeQueue();\\n    } else {\\n        // Log a warning or handle the case where the report is null\\n        logger.warn(\"Attempted to add an item with a null report: {}\", item);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe error indicates that there was an issue during data import due to a missing reference. By identifying and handling these cases, you can prevent future failures and ensure smoother operation of the system.\\n\\nIf you need further assistance or specific code changes, please provide more details about the context in which this exception occurs.'), ('INC4844844', '[NO_TIMESTAMP]\\nRequest for creation of US Only FlexLab X system along with the addition of the following SMNs: \\n10972158\\n10972164\\n10972165\\n10972166\\n10972152\\n10972154\\n10972159\\n10972160\\n10972468\\n10972469\\n10972470\\n10972471\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-03-11T19:03:05]\\nRequest for creation of US Only FlexLab X system along with the addition of the following SMNs: \\n10972158\\n10972164\\n10972165\\n10972166\\n10972152\\n10972154\\n10972159\\n10972160\\n10972468\\n10972469\\n10972470\\n10972471\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-04-03T00:21:24]\\nIncident automatically closed after 21 days in the Resolved state.', 'New System, FlexLab X - US Only has been created in MCMn with the same Instruments and Accessories  with the Service SMNs that were provided.

The answer is: I don't know, we need to check that and discuss that with the expert. Think is, in the IFUs the Diluent is generally mentioned as optional. It is just needed if the original measurement is outside the measurement range. There are a handful of exceptions where the diluent is really needed to do the testing (SHBG, HAV IgM Ab or Rubella IgM Ab for example), there it is defined as mandatory.\\n\\nAs said, we need to discuss this internally.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\n     Till\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-03-05T16:12:40]\\nHi Pilar,\\n\\nthe diluents are in general listed in the IFUs as optional (meaning not necessarily needed) that is why they are defined in DXQB as optional and you have to select them manually if the customer needs them. There are some diluents that are defined as standard, although the IFU says that they are optional, as there was the assumption that they are used by most of the customers. And as said below, where the diluent is needed (listed as required in the IFU) it is defined as mandatory. Based on that, we currently do not plan to change the set up.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\n    Till\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-03-27T10:09:31]\\nHi Pilar,\\n\\ncan we close the ticket?\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\n    Till\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-03-27T20:34:03]\\nreply from: pilar.barrios@siemens-healthineers.com\\n\\nHello Till:\\n\\nYes please, you can close the ticket.\\n\\nThank you,\\nPilar\\n\\nDe: SHARP Service Desk <healthcare@service-now.com>\\nEnviado el: jueves, 27 de marzo de 2025 03:10 a. m.\\nPara: BARRIOS TORRES, MARIA DEL PILAR <pilar.barrios@siemens-healthineers.com>\\nAsunto: Incident: INC4821071 - new comment added - CPQ #1379885 - Mrs. Elisa Chavez\\n\\nSHARP Service Desk\\n[cid:image001.png@01DB9F1C.8451DDE0]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDear MARIA DEL PILAR BARRIOS TORRES,\\nThe ticket INC4821071 has been updated.

And let me explain why:\\n\\nThe surcharge of consumables is based (weighted) on the unsurcharged revenue of the reagents. Here the situation is that the discount on the reagent (11202699 Procalcitonin (BRAHMS) - Atellica IM - RGT - 100 T) is set to 100%, meaning there is no usurcharged revenue on that reagent .

Please note that Only the MCMn Data Analyst (Global) can make affiliations to systems and DPTs within MCMn.   I will check the SMN 11697972 and ensure that Global Marketing has requested the affiliation through the proper channels.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2025-01-14T16:30:37]\\nHi,\\n\\nto find 11561179 in DXQB you first need to make all Systems visible in the R&C Choice screen. To do that, click in the upper right corner (below the move to reagents screen button) the show arrow.
