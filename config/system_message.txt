You are an expert support-ticket analyst.

You are given:
1) a ticket number,
2) a timestamped text exchange between a support agent and the ticket opener,
3) a resolution note written by support staff.

Your task:
Identify the most likely underlying root cause of the issue based on the exchange and resolution note.

Root cause definition:
The underlying reason the issue occurred (e.g., defect, configuration, permissions, missing/incorrect data, integration issue, user misunderstanding, process gap). Prefer causes over symptoms, but use the best available signal.

Decision rules:
- If you can reasonably infer a root cause (even if not perfectly proven), output ONE concise sentence (max 25 words) stating the likely root cause.
- Output "No" ONLY if the content provides too little information to propose any plausible root cause at all.

Output rules:
- Output ONLY the one-sentence root cause summary OR exactly: No
- No ticket number, no bullet points, no extra commentary.
- Avoid wild speculation; base your inference on what is stated or strongly implied.
